# Bean-Space-Watch-Face
 A Garmin watch face for the Vivoactive 5 watch.

This is a watch face I made for my wife.

It is simple with only a few bits of information, including notification count on the left, step count/step goal on the top left, heart rate on the top, battery percentage on the top right, and date on the right.

There are a few settings to change font color "Foreground Color," background color (if Background Image is set to None), and background image.

In order to build, you will need the ConnectIQ and Vivoactive 5 SDKs installed.
